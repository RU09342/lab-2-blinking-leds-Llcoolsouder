# Off Board Blink
While it is great to be able to program the TI Launchpad dev boards, sometimes, you don't need or want everything that comes with the dev board. For this reason, TI was kind enough to place the MSP430G2553 IC in a socket so that it is removable. What's great about this is that you can easily program the chip while it is in the dev board, then you can take the chip out of the dev board and use it in any circuit of your choosing. To demonstrate this, I loaded the MSP430G2553 with the exact same code used in [Multiple Blink](https://github.com/RU09342/lab-2-blinking-leds-Llcoolsouder/blob/master/Multiple%20Blink/G2553/main.c). The focus of this part is not the software, but how to apply the microcontroller to any hardware project.

## Resistors and Current
LEDs like all diodes have an extremely low resistance when they are _on_. For most applications we can simply say the resistance is 0 when they are on. This means that if we run the LED directly from the I/O pin on the MSP430G2553 to GND, at a 3.3V drop across the diode it will be on and the max current output of the microcontroller will be driven through the LED. This is neither necessary nor ideal. If the max current of the microcontroller is high enough, this could even break the LED. To fix this, we add a resistor in series with the LED. Using Ohm's Law you can easily calculate the resistor value needed in order to achieve a precise current if you know the voltage drop across your diode. A typical LED drop is around 1.2V. This leaves 2.1V to drop across the resistor. I chose a 1K resistor. This means there should be 2.1 mA through either LED.

## Bulk and Bypass Capacitors
In my circuit I have also included two capcitors on the Vcc input. These are my bulk and bypass capacitors. A typical bulk capacitor is 0.1 uF while a typical bypass capacitor for a digital aplication is 0.01 uF. The purpose of the bulk capacitor is to stabilize the power to the microcontroller. If the power supply voltage sags momentarily, the bulk capacitor can uphold the voltage for a short amount of time. The purpose of the bypass capacitor is to filter out some of the high frequency noise from the inner logic components of the device in order to achieve a cleaner power signal.

## Reset Signal
It is important to note that the MSP430G2553 has a reset pin that resets the processor if the pin goes LOW, so it is important that you connect the reset pin to Vcc. If this pin is left floating, you will achieve very unpredictable results.
